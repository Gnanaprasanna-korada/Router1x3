A router is a network device that is used to connect multiple computer networks together and route data between them. The router with one source and three destinations, as the name suggests, has one input interface or port that is connected to the source network, and three output interfaces or ports that are connected to three different destination networks.

When a device on the source network wants to communicate with a device on one of the destination networks, it sends a network packet containing the destination IP address of the target device. The router receives this packet on its input interface and examines the destination IP address to determine which output interface to use to forward the packet towards its intended destination.

The router uses a routing table to determine the best path for the packet to take, based on factors such as network topology, routing protocols, and network congestion. Once the router has determined the appropriate output interface for the packet, it forwards the packet out of that interface towards the destination network.

Overall, a router with one source and three destinations is a useful tool for connecting multiple networks together and enabling devices on those networks to communicate with each other. It plays an important role in enabling modern computer networks to function effectively and efficiently.
